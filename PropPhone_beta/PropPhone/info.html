		<p><a href = "http://propphone.com">Prop Phone</a> is an inexpensive tool for using a standard iPhone or iPod Touch as a prop for stage, screen, or any situation where sound needs to be triggered remotely and wirelessly in real time.</p>
		
		<p>The app includes a special "ACTION!" view that updates the display as if an actual call is being received, as well as a built-in ringtone. However, any audio track can be selected from the device's iTunes library making Prop Phone an excellent solution for a wide range of theatrical sound design dilemmas requiring wireless queuing.</p> 
		
		<p><a href = "http://propphone.com">Prop Phone</a> is divided into two sections. One to use an iOS device as a stage prop and another to use a device as a wireless controller.  When using <a href = "http://propphone.com">Prop Phone</a> on two iOS devices a connection can be made over WiFi or Bluetooth, yet two iOS devices are not required.  Prop Phone is compatible with any controller capable of sending OSC messages over WiFi (ie. MaxMSP, Lemur, Mrmr, etc.). If no controller device is available, Prop Phone has a built in timer for delay times in second increments up to 10 minutes.</p>

		<p>Detailed instructions, video demonstration, free MaxMSP and MaxMSP Runtime patches, and responsive technical assistance is available via <a href = "http://propphone.com">www.propphone.com</a>.</p>
